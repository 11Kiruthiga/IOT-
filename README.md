PROJECT TITLE:SOCIAL DISTANCING DETECTION 
INTRODUCTION
During Covid 19,maintaining a 2m of social Distancing is a recommended solution by a WHO.In that time most of shops ,malls,theaters and other public Gatherings used to draw circles to maintain social Distancing.In alternative to this,we create a System which will monitor a Social Distancing between Peoples.
WORKING :
The System will monitor a Social Distancing between people through recouded video.If people follows proper(2m) of Social Distancing ,the system will indicate by using a green colour bounding box over a person or else if any social distancing violation is happens,the system will indicate by using a red colour bounding box over a person.
CURRENT PROJECT(Final year Project):
We are developing this same project in a real time,which will monitor a social distancing through live camera along with message indication and Voice alert (Please maintain Social Distance).
